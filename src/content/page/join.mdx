## Work at Cangrejo Ideas

Here we are at Cangrejo Ideas! We're always eager to challenge ourselves in the types of games we create and the audiences we aim to reach, and we're on the lookout for the best teammates to join us on our journey to help us achieve this.

Our team comes from different countries, backgrounds, and walks of life. We have diverse experiences in the video game industry, as well as in other creative fields like animation, illustration, and digital product design. It's this diverse blend of voices and experiences that inspires us to think about games in unconventional ways and ensures that our social calendar is equally diverse and eclectic.

While we're making strides in the right direction, we understand that there are areas where we still need improvement. We strive to change mindsets and behaviors to be more inclusive and celebrate what makes each of us unique. Our ambition is to create a work environment where people feel they can be their authentic selves and have a sense of belonging.

At Cangrejo Ideas, we're a people-centric company with a goal to make a positive impact in the world. We believe that the best way to achieve this is by fostering true diversity of thought and a commitment to creating a workplace where every person is appreciated for who they are and has the space to thrive and grow.
